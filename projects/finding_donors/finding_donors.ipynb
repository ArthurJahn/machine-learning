    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Decision Trees**\n",
    "  1. Both three models I've selected are classification algorithms and can be used for a very large of industry applications. The Decision Tree in particular is a very simple and comprehencive method that can be used for teaching non-technical employees about machine learning and applications range from data exploration, pattern recognition, option pricing in finances and identifying disease and risk trends.\n",
    "  2. The model is easy to interpret and understand, can be used o support human decisions with ease; requires very little data preparation; the time to respond is lower compared to other methods, even with a very large train dataset.\n",
    "  3. Overfitting is a very common issue of decision trees. Correctly managing parameters like `min_samples_leaf` and `max_depth` is a very tricky task and needs a lot of attention.\n",
    "  4. The set of features and the type of predictions needed are best for classifiers and, in particular, Decision Trees can provide good results since there are a considerable number of features and the need to provide boolean predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "  1. One scenario that applies well for SVM is face detection. The Gamma and C parameters can help the definition of good boundaries for classifing each pixel as face or not face, specialy because, in order to maximize de distance between the points and the boundaries defined, takes into account only the closer points to the curve, which are the most relevant data for that purpose.\n",
    "  2. This model can perform well for both linearly separable and non-linearly separable data. The hard thing to do is to find an optimal penalty variable C. Also, it guarantees the glboal maximum, not a local, due to nature of Convex Optimization.\n",
    "  3. Time for training is an issue related to SVM algorithm, it tends to take more time with larger data sets. Also, the C and Gamma parameters can easily overfit.\n",
    "  4. SVM can be a good choice, if combined with grid search, in order to avoid overfitting. Since the booleand classification and the possibility of finding the larger distance between donors and non-donors can be a good alternative for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Ensemble Method AdaBoost**\n",
    "  1. Adaboost is a very simple algorithm and can be used for a large variety of applications, a largely known problem that is solved mostly with Adaboost is customer churn, since it allows the separation of prediction \"parts\".\n",
    "  2. The simplicity and the ease to implement the model with similar results to SVM and much less parameter tweaking is a great advantage of Adaboost.\n",
    "  3. Adaboost is not a good option for noisy data and can be sensitive to outliers because of its exponetial loss function.\n",
    "  4. This model can be a good option because of the binary classification problem that this exercise represents, that fits well for Adaboost.\n",

    "The AdaBoost model can be compared to Sherlock Holmes. Imagine a case in which the detective must decide, based in a couple of previous events (*data*), what happened in a defined situation (*prediction*). He calls up some people who may be related to the events and might help him (*weak learners*), and by interviewing them, he ponderates the relevance of each of their opinions based on the events (*weighting*), for each new interview, he focuses on the failures of the previous one (*boosting*). To decide what is the correct prediction, the detective takes into account the opinion of many people, and based on the weights he attributed to each of them, he can judge what is the best option.\n",

He knows that Peter lies most of the time, John tells the truth most of the time and mary lies about a *Fact one* and tels the truth about a *Fact two*. If he asked them about *Fact two* and the answers were **Yes**, **Yes**, **No** respectively, than he would assume that the right answer might be **Yes**. If he asked about *Fact one* and the answers were **Yes**, **Yes**, **Yes**, the  right answer was **No**. That is exactly how AdaBoost works."

I believe that the 0.007 gained in train data are relative to the increased `n_estimators` with same the `learning_rate` of `1.`, although I thought that the optimized model would have lower `learning_rate` with high `n_estimators`, because of the trade-off between the two parameters.\n",

I believe that the gain of capital is the main feature because it influences directly the result we want to predict, also the capital loss, because if one makes a lot of money, but looses a lot too, this pearson is not what we are looking for. The age is the next because it is much harder to find a very young person earning much money, the elder are more likely to have higher incomes. The education is the fourth and fifth because in general, people with higher degrees have better remuneration. I'm just not very sure about the education level, that can be replaced with hours per week because pepople that work more time, earns more money, if payed by hour."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
