Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "\n",
    "*I'd say that if the `'RM'` feature increases it's likely that the price also increases. On the other hand, if the `'LSTAT'` feature increases then the price tends to decrease. The `'PTRATIO'` is more subtle in the results becouse it has smaller relations to the overall price changes, in part because it can be correlated with the `'LSTAT'` that in most cases where the `'LSTAT'` is high, the `'PTRATIO'` is also higher. But looking at data with fixed `'LSTAT'` and `'RM'`, we can affer that higher `'PTRATIO'` tends to lower prices.*\n",

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

    "*The maximum depth of the model should be 3. That's because, as the depth increases beyond 3, the algorithm looses performance, hence it starts to provide smaller scores for the testing data, it overfits. In this specific example, adding more training data may not lead to better results, since the curve has a very fast conversion, if the number of points is greater than 300, the chart won't change very much, neither changes the testing data plot. What I believe could make some difference is the addition of new useful features witch could lead to better performance.*"

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*The model trained with `max_depth` of 1 suffers from high bias problem, since the model tries to fit into a very simplistic solution that does not correctly represent the data, whereas the model with a maximum depth of 10 suffers from a high variance problem, that provides a very specific solution and cannot be used to estimate other points. The number of errors and the distance between the two curves (training and testing) are the cues to these problems. The first case (underfit) has lower scores and values very similar in both curves. The second one (overfit) has better accuracy on training data, but very low on testing, leading to a big distance between the curves.*"

    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

    "\n",
    "*The best maximum depth is 3. Analyzing the chart of **Complexity Curves** this is the depth that provides good predictions with both train and test data. If we look at depth 2, the score is still low and can be enhanced and the depth of 4 provides a larger distance comparing train and test data, what indicates a little bit of overfitting already. In this case, because the gain provided by a `max_depth` of 4 is very low, i'd take 3 as a best choice.*"

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

In this case, the prediction was lower than what it should be. The Client 2, for instance, has a very small house and may not get more than 200k on his house, but the prediction was higher.
